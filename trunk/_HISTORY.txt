= VERSION HISTORY                            =
==============================================

In general, the 3.0x version and the 3.1x versions come
from the same source repository, so both versions
have basically the same features.
Since the newer black PCB has a slightly different 
circuit, there may be some features only available in
the V3.1x versions.

Note:
-----
V3.0x is ONLY for the "green PCB"
V3.1x is ONLY for the now sold "black PCB"


15.3.2007 V3.05/V3.10 released by Wolferl
First public released version.
- Reworked RX stick reading (does no longer influence PID controllers)
- Camera servos working. Use RX channel 6 für elevation control.
- "Model lost" beeper works now ONLY when ufo switch (K8) is ON (switch open)
- Bootloader
- low throttle limit to prevent motor shutoffs while in flight
- spectrum DX transmitters are now supported.
  set the synchronisation gap to 5 ms or more.
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

19.4.2007 V3.06/V3.11 released by Wolferl
- Bugfix: spurios beeps in flight fixed
- NEW: Holgers brushless ESCs are now supported and tested!

13.5.2007 V3.12 released by Wolferl
- Low voltage detection on the 3.1 PCB can ONLY be positive
- Version split vor ADXRS150 and ADXRS300 gyros
- Bugfix: only 3.1 PCB: beeper did not stop beeping when
  turning off the ufo switch
- Blue LED now flashes when doing M commands (setting params)
- Red LED now flashes if batt voltage is low,
  nice for those ufos with no beeper connected.
- Diff-factors on Roll and Nick are now pure differential factors!
  New P-factor = Old P-factor + old D-factor!
- compass sensor supported (on black PCB only)

04.07.2007 V3.07/V3.13 released by Wolferl
- 3.1 PCB and IDG300: Roll and Nick gyro is now measured with
  3.6 volts reference. When upgrading from a previous version,
  divide roll and nick proportional factors by 1.3
- Compass sensor HMC6352 fully supported
- flip problem fixed (limiting both motors now)
- smoothing of roll and nick stick signals implemented
- camera servos now selectable 0 or 45 degrees

30.12.2007 V308/V3.14 released by Wolferl
- Ufo now continues flight for 3200 cycles (30 sec at timing 6)
  if RX signal is lost
- quick beeping when signal is lost
- fixed DEBUG_MOTORS with I2C ESCs
- DEBUG_SENSORS for visualizing sensor data via UAVPset
- X flight mode now mixed correctly
  mounting change no longer needed
- Baro controlled flight altitude
  new register 4 (TempComp), 9 (BaroProp), 28 (BaroDiff)

02.01.2008 V3.15beta1 released by Wolferl
- AUX1 to AUX3 now do a running light, and show baro lock

04.02.2008 v3.15beta2 released by Wolferl
- fixed an overflow in baro lock (diff param)
- if ch7 on switch-on is > 30 use ch7 as cam roll trim

27.07-2008 v3.15 released by Wolferl
- better Acc-sensor read (saved 300us cycle time)
- Cam servos are active even with 5-ch receivers
- better baro sensor algorithm (since 3.15beta5)
- RX-yaw channel is now filtered like roll and nick channels
- optimized interrupt routine
- A/D conversion now uses more A/D setup time to
  yield better, more accurate results

19.11.2008 V3.15m3 released by Greg Egan
- added non-latching battery alarm and support for 
- Spektrum AR7000 Rx
- removed redundant source from Interrupt routine

= Transferring firmware to the PIC           =
==============================================

If you already have a PIC with at least software version 3.05,
You can upload your new version using the bootloader.
Use UAVPset.exe to do that.

But be careful: If you mock up things completely, you can lock
yourself out. Then you would need a PIC programmer to get things
working again.

==============================================
= SAFETY FIRST!                              =
==============================================

If you work on your ufo model, PLEASE TAKE CARE!

Nowadays, extremely powerful motors and accumulators
can pose a serious threat to your safety.

Safety measures:
- Remove the propellers before you test parameter or firmware modifications
- Work with a good bench power supply instead of an accupack.
  A short circuit will then not be able to destroy your hardware too easily
- Your ufo mainboards electronics can be damaged by 
  electrostatic discharge sparks. Make sure you are doing any
  work at the electronics in an ESD safe workplace.
- When using your transmitter, be sure to use the correct model memory on it.
- Be sure to have no other transmitters on your channel on air.

The author will NOT BE RESPONSABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTS OR
INJURIES IN ANY WAY!

PLEASE do yourself a favour and get an insurance which covers risks by doing model flight!
Imaging what happens if you only damage someone elses car or something....
