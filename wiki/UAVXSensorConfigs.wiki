== Introduction ==

This Wiki details the sensors currently supported for each of the major versions of UAVX and UAVXArm.


=== UAVXArm ===

==== Gyros ====


=== Accelerometers ===



==== IMU Boards ====


=== UAVX 18F2620 PIC @ 40MHz ===

40MHz is the preferred clock rate for UAVX PIC.

==== PID Update Rate ====

*250 Hz or 500Hz with I2CESCs

==== Gyros ====

*MLX90609-R2
*ADXRS150/613
*IDG300
*LY530
*ADXRS300/610 Analog Devices
*ITG3200
*MPU6050

==== Accelerometers ====

*LIS3L
*ADXL345
*BMA180
*MPU6050

==== Barometer ====

*SMD500 Bosch
*BMP085 Bosch
*MPX4115 Freescale
*MS5611 Measurement Systems 

==== Compass/Magnetometer ====

HMC5883L Honeywell (preferred)
HMC5843 Honeywell (superseded)
HMC6352 Honeywell (legacy compass but 100KHz I2C DO NOT BUY)

==== IMU Boards ====

*QuadroUFO MPU6050 ( MPU6050, BMP085 )
*Drotek 10DOF ( ITG3200, BMA180, BMP085, HMC5883XL )
*FreeIMU ( ITG3200, BMA180, MS5611, HMC5883L )
*SparkFun 6DOF ( ITG3200, ADXL345)
*SparkFun 9DOF Sensor Stick ( ITG3200, ADXL345, HMC5843 )

=== UAVX 18F2620 PIC @ 16MHz ===

Notionally superseded with a simple upgrade to 40MHz by replacing the 16MHz crystal with a 10MHz crystal and re-burning the PIC with any 40MHz version of the UAVX firmware after which UAVPset can be used to load further 40MHz versions.

==== PID Update Rate ====

*125 Hz

==== Gyros ====

*MLX90609-R2 Melexis
*ADXRS150/613 Analog Devices
*IDG300 Invensense (legacy - not recommended)
*LY530ALH ST
*ADXRS300/610 Analog Devices

==== Accelerometers ====

*LIS3LV02DQ ST

==== Barometer ====

*SMD500 Bosch
*BMP085 Bosch

==== Compass ====

*HMC6352 Honeywell
