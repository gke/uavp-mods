#summary How to compile the UAVP firmware..

= Compiling your firmware using the compile.bat from uavp-mod =

To compile your own firmware:
   * Download the source from the Downloads section.
   * Download the cc5x compiler (http://www.bknd.com/cc5xfree.exe).
   * Run the executable to install the compiler. Install it into c:\program files\microchip\cc5x.
   * Download MPLAB (http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/...eDoc/mp810.zip).
   * Unzip mp810.zip into a temp directory. Run Install_MPLAB_v810.exe.
   * Unzip the uavp source into a newly created directory.
   * Launch a command prompt and cd into that directory.
   * If not using mod2 or later: Run "copy c:\program files\microchip\cc5x\reloc.inc ."
   * Edit compile.bat to match your UAVP. Settings that you can change are labeled at the top of the file. If you are using Profi-UFO-V315-CAM0-ADX300-PPM.hex the defaults will work for your UAVP.
   * Note: compile.bat removes all previously compiled hex files when building so backup any old hex files if you want to build more than one version.
   * Run compile.bat
   * Done! The batch file will show the firmware built at the end of the build process.

= Compiling your firmware using MPLAB IDE =
   * All of the revisions on this site now contain an MPLab project workspace file (mcw). For the older 16F876 PICs the compiler is used is cc5x which does not readily support simulation within MPLab.
   * For 18F2520 and compatible PICs the compiler used is the C18 provided by Microchip free for non-commercial use. With the exception of sensor inputs full simulation can be performed within MPLab.
