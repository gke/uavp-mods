UAVXNav is a navigation mission planner with an inbuilt ground-station. It allows the entry of waypoints comprising a mission. The desired altitude and loiter time at each waypoint may be set along with the accuracy of waypoint closure.  Waypoints are checked to see whether they are in reasonable line of sight.

GPS, altimeter, waypoint coordinates, aircraft coordinates and position and altitude errors are displayed in flight along with other information including the position of the aircraft relative to the launch point.

After the flight statistics may be read showing any sensor failures along with Rx errors etc.

Video shows UAVXNav waypoint navigation and auto-land. Starts with the setting of the last of 4 waypoints; manual takeoff with climb to 35M and 5 Sec loiter at waypoint 2; returning to land after 10 sec hold at the launch point. 

Note altitude and position error display along with aircraft location relative to launch. Finally read of in flight stats showing GPS and sensor performance with any Rx failures. 

Uses UAVX simulation mode. Google maps track to follow in next version of UAVXNav but only for simulate mode (Google conditions of use).
