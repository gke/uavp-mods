=Utilizing 40MHz Firmware=

==-In order to use the 40Mhz UAVX firmware, you must remove the 10MHz crystal and replace it with a 16MHz crystal.  Doing this allows the PIC processor to run faster which enhances flight performance due to the faster control loop.==

==- The required crystal can be added to the board if ordered from www.quadroufo.com for about 50 cents.==
==- The crystal is one similar to: http://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=ABL-10.000MHZ-B2virtualkey52750000virtualkey815-ABL-10-B2==
==- The 40MHz firmware in the downloads area is identified by having a "40" in the firmware name.==
