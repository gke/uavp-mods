= 40MHz Versions of UAVX =

== WARNING - READ THIS OR !!!!! ==

Do not load load versions of UAVX with "40" in the name if you are still using the original 16Mhz crystal otherwise *YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH UAVX*.  If you make this mistake will require a PIC programmer to reload the 16Mhz versions.

=== Using the 40MHz Version ===

In order to use the 40Mhz UAVX firmware, you MUST do two things:

  # remove the 16MHz crystal and replace it with a 10MHz crystal and
  # use a PIC programmer to do the first load of a 40MHz version.

The 40MHz versions while not extensively tested will give better performance particularly for smaller (decreased motor spacing) more agile quads.

See the "File Versions" paragraph in the UAVXStartup document in the WIKI for further details on the naming of the UAVX hex files.

=== Where to Get 40MHz Crystals ===

The required crystal can be added to the board if ordered from www.quadroufo.com for about 50 cents.

The crystal is one similar to: http://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=ABL-10.000MHZ-B2virtualkey52750000virtualkey815-ABL-10-B2
