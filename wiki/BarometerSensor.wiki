#summary Sensor options, setup, algorithms, etc.

Sensor options:
   * Current sensor in use: http://www.quadroufo.com/product_info.php?products_id=41&osCsid=81ab2fd57c04dd683a6caa2ab0b250b5
   * Upgraded sensor that we may consider: http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/content/language1/html/3477.htm

Setup:
   * Current recommended settings are TEMP=13,P=1, D=4
   * Note: The BMP085 upgrade is pin compatible with the SMD500.

Current performance:
   * Currrent SMD500 performance is +/- 3-10ft.
   * Improved performance is expected with the BMP085.

Current algorithm / future improvements:
   * TODO: Add information about current algorithm here...
   * The BMP085 adds higher resolution and speed.  It is a one line change to the code:
The resolution mode can be set by the variable "oversampling_setting" (0,1,2,3) in the C source code.
